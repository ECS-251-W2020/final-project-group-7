Doatz: A Blockchain Based E-Voting System
===
#Overview
Voting plays an important role in collective life. Traditional methods are always being questioned on privacy and credibility, while those problems can be easily solved by blockchain due to its data structure. Previous blockchain based E-voting systems mainly focus on nation-wide voting program which costs a lot of computation power and requires highly secured authentication. We build a user-friendly android application supporting universal voting scenes that are difficult to tamper and proved to be anonymous. We use mobile phone's physical information and personal ID to create unique private key to create anti-counterfeiting signature. Instead of fingerprint or other physiological characteristics, mobile phones are secure enough for daily authentication and easy to access.
